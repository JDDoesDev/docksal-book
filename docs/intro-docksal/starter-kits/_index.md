## Start Developing Faster

Docksal ships with many different starter-kits out of the box to allow you to spin up a new project rapidly. In addition, the Docksal repo has many other starter-kits available for download or to extend in your own Dockerfile. In this section we're going to examine a few and see how to use them.

### Default Starter-kits

As noted in the "What's Docksal?" section, there are several starter-kits that you can use to create a project.

They are:

* Drupal 8
* Drupal 7
* Wordpress
* Magento
* Laravel
* Symfony Skeleton
* Symfony WebApp
* Grav CMS
* Backdrop CMS
* Hugo
* Gatsby JS
* Angular

In addition, here are some of the other services that are available on Docksal's Github:

* backstopjs
* bats
* behat
* blog
* blt-docksal
* boilerplate-bedrock
* boilerplate-blt
* boilerplate-nodejs
* ci-agent
* circleci-orbs
* docker-machine-smb
* docker-ngrok
* electron-app-alpha
* qa-suite
* service-jenkins
* service-jenkins-slave
* service-juniper-vpn
* service-socat
* service-solr
* service-varnish
* webui

Many of these were submitted by the community to the Docksal project and have become available thanks to open-source.

### Summary

Docksal's ecosystem is made richer by starter-kits and boilerplate projects available to its framework. This shows how configurable and customizable it can be, along with allowing developers to take advantage of the work that has already been done in order to rapidly spin up applications for development.
