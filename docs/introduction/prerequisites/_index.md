## Before we begin...

While this training is designed for all skill levels, here are a few things that will help you have the most success.

* A basic understanding of programming concepts
* An understanding of using the command line
* Having VirtualBox, Docker for Mac, or Docker for Windows installed on your machine prior to training (macOS and Windows users)
* Having Docker installed on your machine prior to training (Linux users)
* A Github account

Also, this training is written from the standpoint of a Linux and macOS user. Many commands should be similar on the Windows version of Docker, however, it should be said that I'm not an expert in Windows and won't be able to offer much in the way of debugging in this training.
