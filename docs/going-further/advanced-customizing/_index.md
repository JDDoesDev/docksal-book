## Truly Making a Project Custom

In the last section we customized a few things to change our domain name and the site name. In this section, we're going to show how to extend a stack, change versions of images, and even customize and extend Docksal images using a Dockerfile.

In the following projects, we're going to explore a few scenarios and solutions that can be provided with Docksal. Finished code is available on [Github](https://github.com/jddoesdev/docksal-training-projects) for each scenario, but you'll get the most out of it if you follow them in order and work through them yourself.
