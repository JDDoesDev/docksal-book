### Summary

In this section we went through many of the advanced customizations we can do with Docksal services using `docksal.yml`, `docksal.local`, and even a couple of custom Dockerfiles. We created a two server application, changed hosting providers, wrote our own `fin` commands, and locked down versions of certain tools to keep our team happy. As you can see, Docksal is an extremely flexible and powerful tool.

Next, we're going to look into using local files for settings and variables that should not live in the repo.
