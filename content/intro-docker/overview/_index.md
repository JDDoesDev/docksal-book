### Linux containers

aaa
Docker is an Open Source project based on the concept of Linux containers. What does this mean? At a high-level, this means that Docker runs on top of a host machine's operating system kernel. A Linux container is a packaged application that includes everything it needs to run. Since the application is contained within its own container, the application is extremely portable and easily testable. The portability and testability of Linux containers make them extremely useful and valuable to developers and devops specialists alike.

### But, what's a Docker?

Docker provides an environment and workflow for Linux containers. Think of it as a container tummler, or a system for containers that makes things happen. It accommodates the containers, creates a welcoming environment for them, keeps them working in sync, and prevents them from running rampant across your system.

Docker is available for multiple systems and architectures, including:
* macOS
* Windows
* Many Linux distributions
* AWS
* Google Cloud
* Others not listed
